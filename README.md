# Home-Price-Prediction-Analysis
In this project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Address, Rooms, Type, Price, Seller, etc, and using that to predict the price of a given house. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we perform a linear regression model. Also, we apply ridge and lasso regression algorithms because the model is overfitting.
